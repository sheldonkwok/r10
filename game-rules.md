# Red 10: How to Play

## 🃏 Objective
Red 10 is a **team-based** game where the objective is to have your entire team get rid of all the cards in their hands before the opposing team gets rid of their cards first. It is similar to Big 2 (aka 13) but with a few added layers.

## 👥 Teams and Dealing
* **Players and Cards:** Each person (6 players total) will be dealt **13 cards**.
* **Team Formation:** Teams are decided by: Who has a **Red 10** in their hand and who doesn't have a Red 10.
    * Teams can be **3 vs 3**, **2 vs 4**, or **1 vs 5**.

## 🤝 Pre-Game Actions: Jiu & Liang
Before each game, players can "Jiu" or "Liang" to force all players with Red 10s to reveal their Red 10s. This doubles the stakes of the round and points are doubled. The player who reveals should have very strong cards and is expected to win the game.

* **"Jiu"**: Non-Red 10 player can reveal a **BOMB** to everyone.
* **"Liang"**: Red 10 player can reveal his/her **Red 10** to everyone.

## ♠️ Playing Cards and Card Types
You get rid of cards by playing them in a turn-based fashion. Each turn will start off with a certain type: singles, pairs, straights, and bombs. The type must be played in continuation until the end of that round.

### Round Start Types
Each round can start with either:
* **Single**
* **Pair**
* **Straight** (3 card minimum $\rightarrow$ 13 card)
* **Dragon** (Minimum 3 card straight of pairs and above)
* **Bomb**

### Bombs 💣
Bombs are defined as:
* **3 of a kind** (**44A** is the highest 3 card bomb).
* **4 of a kind** (**44AA** is the highest 4 card bomb).
* **5 of a kind** (**44AAA** is the highest 5 card bomb).
* **6 of a kind** (**44AAAA** is the highest 6 card bomb).
* **2 Red 10s** (equivalent to 5 card bomb).
* **3 Red 10s** (equivalent to 6 card bomb).

#### Bomb Notes:
* No other variation of the 4-A combinations (e.g. 4AA) is a bomb.
* **2 Red 10s** cannot beat a 5-card bomb, and vice versa.
* **2 Black 10s** can beat 2 Red 10s and turn the round into **Pairs**.
* **3 Black 10s** can beat 3 Red 10s and turn the round into **Bombs**.
* **Dragons** (straight of pairs) can only be bombed by 4 card bombs and higher.

## ➡️ Cha-Go Maneuvers
Cha-Go is a special sequence that can only be initiated when the round begins with a **Single** card.

* If the round begins with a **Single**, you can **CHA a pair of the same cards** (and skip others before you).
* If someone else CHA's, you may **GO** on top of that with a higher single card.
* Cha-Go only follows: $1\rightarrow2\rightarrow1\rightarrow2~OR~1\rightarrow2\rightarrow3$.
* You can not Cha on a pair.
* Once a Cha-Go is instituted, no one else can bomb on top of it.

## 🏆 Winning & Turns
### Winning a Round
The team that wins is the team that:
* Has someone get **FIRST**.
* Have everyone finish **NOT LAST**.
* Otherwise, if your team completes only one of the two requirements - the round ends in a **wash**.

### Turns
On your turn you can:
* Play a higher type than what's on the pile.
* Skip your turn.

The winner of the previous round will start the next round with whatever type they want.

## 🔢 Scoring (Points)
Scoring is based upon **how many players of the losing team are left**.

| Outcome | Losing Players Left (N) | Winning Team Score (Each Player) | Losing Team Score (Each Player) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Winning Team gets all out** (e.g., 3 vs 3) | **N = 1** | +1 point | -1 point |
| **Winning Team gets all out** (e.g., 1 vs 5) | **N = 5** | +25 points (N * N) | -5 points |

* *Note*: If "Jiu" or "Liang" was played, all points are **doubled**.
